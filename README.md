# Introduction üåü

Connect 4 is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns
dropping their colored discs from the top into a grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying
the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect-four of
one‚Äôs own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The
two players keep playing until the board is full. The winner is the player having greater
number of connected-fours.

## Problem Statement ‚ùì

It is required to support the following 3 algorithms as options for the AI agent:
‚Ä¢ Minimax without alpha-beta pruning
‚Ä¢ Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
‚Ä¢ Expected Minimax : probability that disc falls in chosen column is 0.6 and 0.4 that it
will into the column on left or right

##### Admissibility and Consistency
  - **Heuristic Definition:** The heuristic is defined as:
  - ```H(state) = (H_actual_AI - H_actual(Player)) + (H_potential(AI) - H_potential(Player))```
    - Where:
        - ````H_actual(AI)```: Number of completed 4s by the AI.
        - ```H_actual(Player)```: Number of completed 4s by the human player.
        - ```H_potential(AI)```: Number of potential 4s by the AI.
        - ```H_potential(Player)```: Number of potential 4s by the human player. 
      
  -**Admissibility Criterion:** A heuristic H(state) is **admissible** if:
  ```H(state) <= H*(state)```
    Where:
      - H(state): The heuristic estimate of the utility value of the state.
      - H*(state): The true utility value (i.e., the actual utility that can be achieved starting from this state). 

  - **Components of the Heuristic:**
    1. **Actual Difference**: ```H_actual(AI) - H_actual(Player)```
       - This term is **exact** and does not overestimate the true utility, as it only reflects already completed 4s.
    2. **Potential Difference**: ```H_potential(AI) - H_potential(Player)```
       - This term conservatively estimates the difference in potential 4s between the AI and the human player.

  - **Why the Heuristic is Admissible:**
      1. **Exactness in ```H_actual```:**
         - The first term ```H_actual(AI) - H_actual(Player)``` is accurate because it directly reflects the current utility difference.
       2. **Conservativeness in ```H_potential```:**
          - The second term ```H_potential(AI) - H_potential(Player)``` measures the difference in potential utility, not the absolute potential for either player. This avoids overestimation.
       3. **Interaction Between Players:**
          - By focusing on **differences**, the heuristic respects the zero-sum nature of the game: one player's gain limits the other's opportunities.
       4. **No Overestimation:**
          - The heuristic does not assume that both players can simultaneously complete conflicting potential 4s, ensuring it remains conservative. 
       5. **Monotonicity:** 
          - As the game progresses:
            - ```H_actual(AI)``` and ```H_actual(Player)``` increase as players complete more lines.
            - ```H_potential(AI)``` and ```H_potential(Player)``` decrease as fewer opportunities remain.
          - The heuristic remains consistent and never overestimates the true utility value.
  - **Conclusion:** 
  - The heuristic: ```H(state) = (H_actual_AI - H_actual(Player)) + (H_potential(AI) - H_potential(Player))``` is **admissible** because:
    1. H_actual accurately measures the current utility difference without overestimation.
    2. H_potential conservatively estimates the potential utility difference.
    3. The heuristic respects the interaction between players and avoids overestimating achievable utility.

  - Recursively calls the `chance` method for each child.
  - Updates the minimum utility and best child node.
  - Updates the node label with the current board state and utility value.

#### `chance(self, depth, board_state, parent_id)`
- **Role**: Executes the chance part of the Expectiminimax algorithm, considering probabilistic outcomes.
- **Inputs**:
  - `depth`: The maximum depth to search in the game tree.
  - `board_state`: A 2D list representing the current state of the game board.
  - `parent_id`: A string representing the parent node ID.
- **Outputs**:
  - `expected_utility`: The expected utility value considering probabilistic outcomes.
- **Flow**:
  - Checks if the board is full or the depth is 0.
  - If true, creates a leaf node with the heuristic value of the board state.
  - Otherwise, creates a new node and adds it to the game tree.
  - Initializes `expected_utility` to 0.
  - Iterates through the children of the board state.
  - Recursively calls the `maximize` or `minimize` method for each child based on the current player.
  - Updates the expected utility by averaging the utilities of the children.
  - Updates the node label with the c
